# JavaScript Documentary Project

## Overview

This project is a complete documentation of my JavaScript learning journey. It covers core concepts, DOM manipulation, OOP, API integration, and practical examples.

## Features

* Clear explanations for each topic
* Fully commented code for easy revision
* Structured in progressive stages (Basics → DOM → OOP → API)
* Demonstrates real-world application of JavaScript concepts

## How It Works

1. **Stage 1: Basics** – Variables, loops, conditions, arrays
2. **Stage 2: DOM Manipulation** – Selecting elements, events, and dynamic updates
3. **Stage 3: Objects & Classes** – Object-oriented programming concepts and examples
4. **Stage 4: APIs** – Fetching data, handling JSON, integrating external APIs

## Key Learnings

* Understanding JavaScript from fundamentals to advanced topics
* Writing clean, maintainable, and documented code
* Applying JavaScript to real-world projects
